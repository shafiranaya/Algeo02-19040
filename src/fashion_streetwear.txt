I am also connected to the craft of streetwear, and I love it. As I grow and mature, I more and more thinking outside the box. I think that it’s important for me to create something I think is interesting, and it’s important for me to be challenged. I want to help people see that a t-shirt can be a statement piece. And people have to see that they can do that too. It’s a fun experience, and you get to connect with other people in a way that online social media can’t.
