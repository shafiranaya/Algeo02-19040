We serve our own sake on draft, and use only the freshest sake available. Fresh sake is delivered to the restaurant daily and is mixed with fresh seasonal ingredients, making us the only Japanese sake restaurant to receive the Japan Society for the Preservation of Japanese Sake Awards. To ensure the quality and freshness of our sake, we use fresh sake mash made in house each day.
