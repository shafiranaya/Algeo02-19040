We serve our customers homemade bread and delicious pasta dishes as well as desserts. We love to use only the best available ingredients when making our food. We also want to make sure that our customers enjoy their meals as much as we do. Our customers can enjoy our food at our private restaurant, which is located next to the restaurant and serves our guests. Please note that the private dining room is only for customers and not guests. We also serve special menus on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. All of our food is served in our restaurant so our customers can enjoy it at their leisure.
