I have a background in professional clinical dermatology since the age 12, I received my doctorate in cosmetic science from Stanford University and trained as an esthetician before applying to work for ten years at Cosmetic Pro Plastics (Sparlona). It was there that this passion grew which led me one amazing journey where i earned my license to practice Dermatology/Racial Dermal Exam, Skin Care & Pregnancy then went on another awesome path by owning Dermatologie LLC back home in Southern California!
