A Washington, D.C., restaurant famous for feeding the homeless is now struggling to stay open because of coronavirus lockdowns.

"Business was doing very well," owner of Sakina Halal Grill, Kazi Mannan, said. "Before COVID-19 hit, we were feeding 70 to 80 people free meals a day."

"We were closed for four months during the pandemic," Mannan said. “Each time we would re-open, we sit all day with no customers. Eventually we would just shut down and let the employees go.”

He said that before the pandemic, he had a steady stream of both paying customers and those in need. But now, he’s stopped giving out free meals.

“I can’t feed anybody because I can’t feed myself in this situation," Mannan said.

“Right now we are in a bad shape and unable to pay rent,” he added. "I am unable to pay my mortgage."

Sakina Halal Grill established a GoFundMe account to help raise money for the homeless and hungry, as well as support the restaurant.

“Kazi Manan introduced a new model of empathy and kindness in America when he opened his restaurant to every person who needs a refuge from their daily hunger. He has never differentiated between a paying or non-paying customer as he is constantly aware of his journey to success – and the difficulties along the way,” the page says.

“Due to the pandemic, however, we are underwater and looking to survive this season so the doors do not close on Sakina Halal Grill,” the page adds.
